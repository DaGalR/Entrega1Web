                                This is a small fragent gifted to my by the cyberspace to talk a little about myself and introducte me to the world. Specially because the quarintine makes it harder or impossible to make contact with
                                other people, so why not use Internet's pros and show you all some things about me? I'll try and do my best to introduce myself as briefly as I can in this web site. First of all, I will say a couple
                                small things about me. The rest you will be able to see it along the webpage.

                            <h3>A little glance about me</h4>
                            <p>
                                I was born and lived my first 3 years of life in Arizona, USA. When coming back to Colombia (my parents are colombian) I studied in a Kindergarden close to my house until I made it to Elementary School.
                                That was when I began studying in Colegio Colombo Americano, where I finished the rest of my school years. At that school I met those who still today are my best friends. At school I always liked my painting
                                classes and that is why I love drawing. I even got to participate in some drawing contests from which I won a couple.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Sports</h3>
                            <p>
                                In terms of sports, I have never been part of an official team. I began practicing Karate and made it up to grey belt. I left it because I felt I was stuck and did not improve as fast as before. Still today I like martial arts and I would like to go
                                back to Karate or maybe another martial art. Some years after leaving Karate behind I started practicing tenis for a long time until I sprained a finger on my left hand. Once again some years passed after I left tenis until I found the next sport to 
                                practice. This time it was boxing but I didn't put much effort nor dedication to it because I only practiced during my vacations. It was until I got hit hard during a sparring session that I quit boxing.

                            <h3>My hobbies</h3> 
                            <p>
                                I enjoy quite a lot playing videogames, listening to music and practice playing on the drums. Reading is also one of my hobbies. My favorite genre is Science Fiction (also for movies and TV series), but I also like suspense and mistery genres. My favorite book 
                                author is Isaac Asimov and I stll got plenty of his books to read. I read a collection of his stories which I loved. In terms of videogames, those are also a lifelong hobby. My first console ever was a PlayStation 1 and then I moved to Xbox consoles. My favorite
                                game to play is Halo which is also the one I play the best. I also enjoy other videogames like RPG (Fable, Skyrim or Fallout), strategy games like Age of Empires and many other shooter games.

                            <h3>Music</h3>
                            <p>
                                Talking about music, the first band I remember listening to was Coldplay but soon I also discovered other bands and music genres. Rock is my favorite kind of music, and I also like its subgenres like progressive rock, indie rock and so on. Pink Floyd and Led
                                Zeppelin became my top listened bands from a long time ago and still are unbeatable among the other groups I listen to. Those other groups and genres are jazz, funk, metal, world music, salsa and some folklore music from Colombia. When I really began enjoying
                                music was when I also wanted to pick up an instrument and begin to play it. A few years ago I discovered my love for drumming and I am still learning today, trying to improve under the shadow of my drumming idol, Bonzo from Led Zeppelin.

                                I like this video because of the music but also due too the drawing and animation it has. The video was made by the artist Felix Colgrave for the song  <em>Source</em> by the band Fever the Ghost.

                                The best drum solo according to me, is the one performed by John Henry Bonham (Bonzo) from Led Zeppelin. The solo is part of the song <em>Moby Dick</em> and this video is my favorite version of the solo. I watch this video often to learn from Bonzo's playing, who is my drummer idol.

                                This video is one of my favorites from the few made by Pink Floyd. This video was filmed for the song <em>High Hopes</em> from the album The Division Bell. The visual material used connects very accurately the lyrics with the song's music.

                                This is the music video from the song <em>Daydreamming</em> of Radiohead. I love it for its direction work. It has several visual techniques that feed the introspective, hypnotic melody of the song.

                            <h3>My rock band Ecos de la Cumbre</h3>
                            <p>Up to some point in my life, my best friend and I wanted to engage in learning how to play an instrument. He chose to play bass guitar and I chose the drums: The perfect combination. This added up to our synchrony in terms of music taste and 
                                our way to appreciate music. We talked a lot about the same bands and songs and we could spend hours just discusing what we like about the music we heard. After a while sharing all those point of views we began joking about starting a band
                                becausewe already had the inspiration and we would count as two musicians in the band. That idea sticked in our heads until some time later when I came by a rehearsal house where many amateur bands went to play. Ever since, the idea of starting
                                the band began materializing as we played some covers. A lot after that, we could finally play along effectively and then we decided that it was time to bring other people to play guitar and sing. So we contacted some friends who play the guitar
                                who then joined us and keep jamming with us nowadays. Finally we found a singer who has been with us some short time. The five of us have been playing for a year together and by the time we only play covers but soon we expect to begin writing our
                                own songs. Also, we expect to be playng live as soon as everything comes back to normal.

                            <h3>PetFun</h3>
                            <p>PetFun is a project made to help dog owners to avoid having their things damaged by their pets, especially when the pets are left home alone. This project was developed algo with three other peers using Python programming language. It uses a camera
                                which is set on when the owner leaves his house and it must be placed anywhere the owner wants to avoid his pet entering into the house. When the camera detects the pet trying to enter a room or somewhere else in the house, the system will generate
                                distracting sounds so that the dog will not go into the room.
